abstract = {In recent years, ransomware attacks have grown dramatically. New variants continually emerging make tracking and mitigating these threats increasingly difficult using traditional detection methods. As the landscape of ransomware evolves, there is a growing need for more advanced detection techniques. Neural networks have gained popularity as a method to enhance detection accuracy, by leveraging low-level hardware information such as hardware events as features for identifying ransomware attacks. In this paper, we investigated several state-of-the-art supervised learning models, including XGBoost, LightGBM, MLP, and CNN, which are specifically designed to handle time series data or image-based data for ransomware detection. We compared their detection accuracy, computational efficiency, and resource requirements for classification. Our findings indicate that particularly LightGBM, offer a strong balance of high detection accuracy, fast processing speed, and low memory usage, making them highly effective for ransomware detection tasks.},
